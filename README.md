#NC NEWS Front End Project

This repository contains the front end for my NC News project hosted at https://nc-news-newsboard.netlify.app/. This project uses the REST api created in my back end repository https://github.com/dylank03/nc-news-project to handle requests.

##Description 

A news application where users can post, comment and vote on articles. Articles can be filtered by topic and sorted by votes, no. of comments etc. 

note: The application may take up to a minute to load due to the spin down times caused by hosting the back end on render.
